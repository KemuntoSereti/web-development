      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. 
      CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer
      questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content
      display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I 
      decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
     </p>
  
    <h2 id="html-css-header">What is CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language
      either.<strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong>what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS 
      selects paragraph text, setting the color to red and the heading to color blue with a yellow background:
     </p>
      <img 
      src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/selector.png"
      alt="setting color red"
      width="500"
      />   
      <p>
      Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above)
      into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory named styles.
     </p>
      <p>
      To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document.
      Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been
      following our project, pause here to read

    <li>Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head (between the <head> and </head> tags):</li>

    alt="testing html code"
    width="500"
    /> 
      <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see something like this:</li>
     
      <img

      alt="testing html code"
      width="500"
      /> 
       
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.</p>
      
  <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
  <p>
    Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :
    </p>
    <img 
      src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"
      alt="Anatomy of a CSS ruleset"
      width="500"
      />
    <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) 
      Note the names of the individual parts:</p>

<h3>Selector</h3>
<p>
  This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled 
  (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
  </p>
  
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>
  This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) 
In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
</p>
<h3>Property value</h3>
<p>
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible 
appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
</p>
<p>
Note the other important parts of the syntax:

<li>
  Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})
</li>
<li>
  Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
</li>
<li>
  Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
</li>
To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:
  </p> 
    <h2>Selecting multiple elements</h2>
    <p>
      You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors 
      by commas. For example:
    </p>
    <h2>Different types of selectors</h2>
    <p>
      There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a 
      given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors:
      There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the MDN Selectors guide.
